iASE1267 model.xml ——   This is the SBML input file of the reconstructed Genome-scale model (GEM) iASE1267 for Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110, encompassing 2,227 metabolic reactions, 1,551 metabolites, and 1,267 metabolic genes. 

ComputationalStrainDesign —— This folder includes all codes for identifying static engineering strategies enhancing target biosynthesis using the metaheuristic approach that incorporated OptRAM with non-sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) based on the multi-dimensional model. The subfolder OptRAM is the revised version of our OptRAM approach with BPCY and WYIELD setting as the dual objective functions.

DynamicMetabolicValve —— This folder includes the code to identify dynamic interventions redirecting metabolic flux towards optimal target biosynthesis within the feasible metabolic flux space by the Modular Vector Engineering (MoVE) method.
